We are team TrailBlazers and worked on Huddle01 AI tracks where we integrated Anthropic Infra to the existing openAI infra in huddle. Further, we also implemented a realtime trading bot querying a master LLM which connects to multiple experts for relevant context retrieval via huddle.
Please find a detailed demo: https://www.loom.com/share/ef3b31ffaf9b4c17b8ea41f590b2f45c
For the base documentation, please look at the README.md of https://github.com/Huddle01/huddle01-ai
Fingers crossed!
