# TrailBlazers

## Overview

At **TrailBlazers**, we collaborated on challenging problem statements proposed by **Huddle01** and **LIT** during **ETH24**. Our primary focus was on enhancing Huddle01's AI infrastructure and developing a cutting-edge real-time trading bot.

## Key Contributions

### 1. LLM Integration

- **Objective:** Integrate Anthropic-based models into Huddle01's existing OpenAI-based infrastructure.
- **Challenges:**
  - Transitioned support from audio-based models to text-based communication.
  - Navigated and modified a complex codebase, creating new abstract classes.
  - Extended existing model options to accommodate Anthropic infrastructure.
- **Outcome:** Successfully merged Anthropic's text capabilities, enhancing the versatility and functionality of Huddle01's AI systems.

### 2. Real-Time Trading Bot

- **Objective:** Develop a sophisticated trading bot as part of Huddle01's AI track.
- **Architecture:**
  - Utilized Huddle01's API to connect a master Large Language Model (LLM) with multiple specialized expert LLMs.
  - Based on user input, the master LLM coordinates with experts to retrieve relevant context.
  - Updates essential parameters for the algorithmic trading bot to execute trades effectively.
- **Impact:** Delivered a robust real-time trading solution, demonstrating our ability to handle complex AI-driven trading strategies.
